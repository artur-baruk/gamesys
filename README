The library 'gamesys' allows calculating series of numbers. It consists of one module named 'Gamesys'.

In order to build the library you will need the Haskell environment platform installed on your machine:
- GHC in version above 7.8.1
- Cabal build tool in verison above 1.18 

The library exports three functions:
- series that returns series when x,y and length of series is specified
- specialNumbers - returns special numbers based on specified x, y, z and length of series parameters
- specialNumbersFromSet - returns special numbers based on specified series and parameter z

***************************************************
Build and install instruction:

To build the library you need to invoke 'cabal build' command on 'gamesys' directory.
It will create an object file: dist/build/Gamesys.o

In order to install the library use: 'cabal install' command.

***************************************************
Testing:

The project makes use of HSpec library for tetsting exported functions. Before running tests you need
to enable this functionality with: 'cabal install --enable-tests' command (invoke it once). 
To run test cases use: 'cabal test'. Feel free to add your own test cases (it may require modifying 
gamesys.cabal file if you add dependencies to other libraries or you create another file with test cases).
